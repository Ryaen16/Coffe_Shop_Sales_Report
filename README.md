# Coffe_Shop_Sales_Report

I have downloaded this Coffee Shop Sales dataset from Mavenanalytics which contains Transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. Dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details.

# Analysis done on this dataset
- How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?

- Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?

- Which products are sold most and least often? Which drive the most revenue for the business?

I've created a dashboard based on this dataset to get the detailed analysis.
Also I've created different pivot tables, slicers, trackers for the given dataset to get insight about different business problems.
